A **piece of evidence** is a new belief about the probability distribution of a node. 
We can force a node to have a specific value and observe what happens to the other nodes.

 1. Choose the node you have new information about. 
 
 2. A new drop-down list will show up, from which you can set the node's new value.
 
 3. Click on the **SET EVIDENCE** button.
             
            
You can repeat these steps for as many nodes as you want. To remove one node, just select
it from the drop-down list on the left and click on the **REMOVE EVIDENCE** button. 
To remove all the pieces of evidence, click on the **RESET ALL** button.
